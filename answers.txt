What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
The difference between a merge and rebase somewhat deals with how theyre being used.
Typically when merging, you would have peformed a fetch, and when you fetch a commit you have not had before, you would use merge to essentially add the new code to your repository.
This is literally "merging" a commit into your repository thus updating your repository.
Now when dealing with rebase, it also has the functionality of updating too. When you perform a rebase, instead of merging, you essentially make your branch/repository start at whatever rebase you specify.
What occurs is that it is as if you just freshly created a branch off the specified commit. (updating the start of your branch to a later commit)
